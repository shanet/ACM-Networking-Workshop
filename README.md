### About

Penn State ACM Fall 2013 Intro to Network Programming Workshop

Two simple example chat Python programs are provided.

* `simple-chat.py` is a very basic chat client where two users may only send or receive messages at once.
* `threaded-chat.py` is a slightly more advanced chat client where two users may send and receive messages simultaneously.

Accompanying presentation on network is available at http://acm.psu.edu/workshops.

### Running

Both examples are compatible with Python 2.7. Simply run them like any other Python script.
